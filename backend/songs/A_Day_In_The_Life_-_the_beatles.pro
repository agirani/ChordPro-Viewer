 [G] [Bm] [Em] [Em7] [C] [C]

[G] I read the [Bm]news today, oh [Em]boy [Em7]
[C] About a [C/B]lucky man who [Asus2]made the grade
[G] And though the [Bm]news was rather [Em]sad [Em7]
[C] Well, I just [F]had to laug[Em]h [Em7]
[C] I saw the [F]photogra[Em]ph [C]

[G] He blew his [Bm]mind out in a [Em]car [Em7]
[C] He didn't [C/B]notice that the [Asus2]lights had changed
[G] A crowd of [Bm]people stood and [Em]stared [Em7]
[C] They'd seen his [F]face before
[Em]Nobody was really sure
If [Em7]he was from the House of [C]Lords

[G] I saw a [Bm]film today, oh [Em]boy [Em7]
[C] The English [C/B]Army had just [Asus2]won the war
[G] A crowd of [Bm]people turned [Em]away [Em7]
[C] But I just [F]had to look
[Em] Having [Em7]read the [C]book
I’d love to [Em/F#]turn  [Em/G]  you  [Em/A]  on  [Em/B] [Em/C#] [Em/D]                   
[Em]{c:(orchestral glissando)}

Woke [E]up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my [Dsus2]head
Found my [E]way downstairs and [B7sus4]drank a cup
And [E]looking up I [B7sus4]noticed I was late
Found my [E]coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds [Dsus2]flat
Found my [E]way upstairs and [B7sus4]had a smoke
[E]Somebody spoke and I [B7sus4]went into a dream.

([C]Aaaa[G]aaaa[D]aaaa[A]hhhh[E]hhhh[C]hhhh[G]hhhh[D]hhhh[A]) [E] [D] [C] [D]

[G]I read the [Bm]news today oh [Em]boy [Em7]
[C]Four thousand [C/B]holes in Blackburn, [Asus2]Lancashire
[G]And though the [Bm]holes were rather [Em]small [Em7]
[C]They had to [F]count them all
[Em]Now they know how many holes it [Em7]takes to fill the Albert [C]Hall
I’d love to [Em/F#]turn  [Em/G]  you  [Em/A]  on  [Em/B] [Em/C#] [Em/D]
