[A]You can tell the world, you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I am [E]gone
Or [E]you can tell your friends, just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the [A]phone

[A]You can tell my arms, go back into the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the [E]floor
Or [E]you can tell my lips, to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no [A]more

But [A]don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd under[E]stand
And [E]if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this [A]man
Uuu[A]uuuuu..

[A]You can tell your maw, I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my [E]leg
Or [E]tell your brother Cliff, whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me any[A]way

Go [A]tell your aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not o[E]kay
Or [E]you can tell my eye, watch out for my mind
It might be walkin' out on me one [A]day

But [A]don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd under[E]stand
And [E]if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this [A]man
Uuu[A]uuuuu..

[A]Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd under[E]stand
And [E]if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this [A]man

N.C.
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

I just don't think he'd understand

And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

He might blow up and kill this man
Uuu[A]uuuuu..
