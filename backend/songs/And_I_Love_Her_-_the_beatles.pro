 [F#m] [E6]

[F#m]    I give her [C#m]all my love
[F#m]    That's all I [C#m]do
[F#m]    And if you [C#m]saw my love
[A]  You'd love her [B]too
I love [E]her

[F#m]    She gives me [C#m]everything
[F#m]    And tender[C#m]ly
[F#m]    The kiss my [C#m]lover brings
[A]  She brings to [B7]me
And I [E6]love her

[C#m]    A love like [B]ours
[C#m]    Could never [G#m]die
[C#m]    As long as [G#m]I
Have you [B]near me [B7]

[F#m]    Bright are the [C#m]stars that shine
[F#m]    Dark is the [C#m]sky
[F#m]    I know this [C#m]love of mine
[A]  will never [B7]die
And I [E6]love her
