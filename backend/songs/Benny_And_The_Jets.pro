[Verse 1]

 Am7       D
Hey kids, shake it loose together
    G
The spotlight's hitting something
            Abdim7
That's been known to change the weather
  Am7                D
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
       Em         Am                       Bm
So stick around you're gonna hear electric music
       C
Solid walls of sound


[Chorus]

    G
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
 Am7                         C7            C
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
   G
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
   Am7
Oh, Bennie she's really keen

            C                 D
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
            Em                    C
You know I read it in a magazine oh,ho
 Bb/C                  G      F
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets


[Verse 2]

   Am7      D
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
  G
Maybe they're blinded
            Abdim7
But Bennie makes them ageless
   Am7        D                           Em
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
         Am                         Bm
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
                               C
To find who's right and who's wrong


[Chorus]

    G
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
 Am7                         C7            C
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
   G
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
   Am7
Oh, Bennie she's really keen
            C                 D
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
            Em         Em/D         C
You know I read it in a magazine oh,ho
 Bb/C                  G      F
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
