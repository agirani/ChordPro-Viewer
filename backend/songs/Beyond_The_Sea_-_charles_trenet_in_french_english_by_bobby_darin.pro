Some[G]where[Em]----[C]---[D7]beyond the [G]sea  
[Em]Some[C]where [D7]waiting for [G]me-[B7]----[Em]---
[D7]My lover [G]stands on [Em]golden [C]sands-[E7]----[Am]-
And [D7]watches[Adim] the  [Em]ships 
[C]that go [A7]sail[D]ing [D7]

Some[G]where[Em]----[C]---[D7]beyond the [G]sea 
[Em]She's [C]there [D7]watching for [G]me-[B7]----[Em]--
[D7]If I could [G]fly like [Em]birds on [C]high-[E7]----[Am]-
Then [D7]straight to [Adim]her   [Em]arms 
[C]I'd go [Am7]sail-[D7]----[Gm7]ing

[F#7]It's [B]far-[G#dim]------[E6]----
[F#7]beyond a [B]star [G#dim]    
it's [E6]near 
[F#7]beyond the [B]moon-----

[Bm]my [Em]heart will [A7]lead me there [D]soon [D7] [Bm]

[D7] We'll [G]meet-[Em]----[C]---[D7]beyond the [G]shore,
[Em]we'll [C]kiss [D7]just as be[G]fore-[B7]---[Em]--
[D7]Happy we'll [G]be bey[Em]ond the [C]sea-[E7]---- [Am]
And [D7]never [Adim]a----[Em]gain, 
[C]I'll go [A7]sail-[D7]----[G]ing
