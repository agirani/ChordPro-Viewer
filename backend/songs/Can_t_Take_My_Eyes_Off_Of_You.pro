 [D] [Dm] [C]
{c:x2}

You're just too [C]good to be true.
Can't take my [Cmaj7]eyes off you.
You'd be like [C7]heaven to touch.
I wanna [F]hold you so much.
At long [Fm]last love has arrived.
And I thank [C]God I'm alive.
You're just too [D]good to be true.
[Dm]Can't take my [C]eyes off you.

Pardon the [C]way that I stare.
There's nothing [Cmaj7]else to compare.
The sight of [C7]you leaves me weak.
There are no [F]words left to speak.
But if you [Fm]feel like I feel.
please let m[C]e know that it's real.
You're just too [D]good to be true.
[Dm]Can't take my [C]eyes off you.
