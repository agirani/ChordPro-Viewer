[G]Comes a time,[Bm]  when you’re driftin’
[D]  Comes a time, when you [Am7]settle down [C]
[G]  Comes a light,[Bm]  feelings liftin’
[D]  Lift that baby right up [Am7]off the ground [C]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]

[G]You and I,[Bm]  we were captured
[D]  We took our souls, and we [Am7]flew away [C]
[G]  We were right,[Bm]  we were giving
[D]  That’s how we kept what we [Am7]gave away [C]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]

[(G)]There comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime, comes a [G]time
Comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime [G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime
