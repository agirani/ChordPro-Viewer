{title: DONâ€™T TAKE ME ALIVE}
{subtitle: Steely Dan}

This old thing from The Royal Scam album has some tricky parts
in it, a lot of electric guitar shots etc. which tend to moderate
the sound of the chord, but I've tried to make it playable, while
staying as true to the actual song as possible. Note that there
is a syncopation to this song which makes it difficult to place
the chords over the words as they change, or present it in the
form of an even 4/4 bar count. My advice is play the chart along
with the record if you get confused.

Also, I've included two different shapes for an F/G chord to be played
at different times. One will be called F/G*, and the other F/G**.

This tune is one of my favorite examples of brilliant Steely Dan
lyrics and their usual superbly crafted music.


INTRO:
First slowly strum out a G7#9 with this shape: EADGBE
                                               355466
This may look like an impossibility, like a cruel, unusual and
unplayable chord, but it can be done. You must use the power
of the force. First you use your ring (3rd) finger to cover
BOTH the 4th and 5th strings on the 5th fret (straight down on
the fingertip, not barred), and next you  use the baby finger to
barr both the 1st and 2nd strings on the 6th fret. Of course your
index finger is on the 6th string, 3rd fret, and your middle
finger is on the 3rd string, 4th fret. Once you've let it ring
for a few seconds you quickly play Eb/Ab and F/G* (shapes shown
below) as the last two beats of a lead-in bar, and you're into
the intro, which is a guitar solo over:

BRIDGE:  There is some keyboard and guitar work here which
mostly is played over a 'C' bass note, and although it would
be messy to try to write it out note for note, I think you
can get away with playing these chords: (formations shown below).
