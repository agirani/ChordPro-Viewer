[C]  [G]  [D]   [G] [D]  [C]   [C]  [G]  [Em]


It's a [C]still life [G]water [D]color
Of a [C]now late [G]after[D]noon
As the [C]sun shines [G]through the [Am]curtain lace
And [G]shadows wash the [Em]room
And we [G]sit and drink our coffee
[F]Cast in our indifference, like [E]shells upon the shore
You can [D]hear the ocean roar
In the [C]dangling [G]conver[D]sation, and the [G]super[D]ficial [C]sighs
The borders of our [G]lives [Em]

And you [C]read your [G]Emily [D]Dickenson
And [C]I my [G]Robert [D]Frost
And we [C]note our [G]place with [Am]bookmarkers
That [G]measure what we've [Em]lost
Like a [G]poem poorly written
We are [F]verses out of rhythm, [E]Couplets out of rhyme
In [D]syncopated time
And the [C]dangling [G]conver[D]sation, And the [G]super[D]ficial [C]sighs
Are the borders of our [G]lives [Em]

Yes we [C]speak of [G]things that [D]matter
With [C]words that [G]must be [D]said
Can [C]analys[G]is be [Am]worthwhile
Is the [G]theater really [Em]dead?
And [G]how the room is softly faded
And I [F]only kiss your shadow, I [E]cannot feel your hand
You're a [D]stranger now unto me

Lost in the [C]dangling [G]conver[D]sation, And the [G]super[D]ficial [C]sighs
In the borders of our [G]lives [Em]
