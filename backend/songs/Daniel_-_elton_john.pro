[C]Daniel is traveling tonight on a [Dm]plane 
[G]I can see the red tail lights [E7]heading for [Am]Spain 
Oh and [F]I can see [G]Daniel waving good[Am]bye 
God it [F]looks like Daniel, [G7]must be the [F]clouds in my [C]eyes

[C]They say Spain is pretty though I've never [Dm]been 
[G]Well Daniel says it's the best place that [E7]he's ever [Am]seen 
Oh and [F]he should [G]know, he's been there e[Am]nough 
Lord [F]I miss Daniel, [G7]oh I [F]miss him so [C]much oh oh oh

[F]Daniel my brother you are [C]older than me 
Do you still [F]feel the pain of the [C]scars that won't heal? 
Your eyes have [Am]died but you see more than [F]I 
[Fm]Daniel you're a [C]star [A7]in the face of the [Dm]sky  [G7]
