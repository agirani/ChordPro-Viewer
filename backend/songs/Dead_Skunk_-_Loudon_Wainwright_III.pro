Cr[G]ossing the highway [D]late last night,
He [C]shoulda looked left and he [G]shoulda looked right.
He [G]didn't see the station [D]wagon car.
The [C]skunk got squashed and [G]there you are.

You got your [G]dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
[C]Dead skunk in the [G]middle of the road
[G]Dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
[C]Stinking to high [G]heaven

 [G] [D] [C] [G]

Take a [G]whiff on me. That [D]ain't no rose.
[C]Roll up your window and [G]hold your nose.
You [G]don't have to look and you [D]don't have to see
'Cause you can [C]feel it in your ol[G]factory.

You got your [G]dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
[C]Dead skunk in the [G]middle of the road
[G]Dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
And it's [C] stinking to high [G]heaven

 [G] [D] [C] [G]
 [G] [D] [C] [G]

Yeah, you [G]got your dead cat and you [D]got your dead dog.
On a [C]moonlight night you got your [G]dead toad frog.
You got your [G]dead rabbit and your [D]dead raccoon.
The [C]blood and the guts, they gonna [G]make you swoon.

You got your [G]dead skunk,[D]  in the middle,
[C]Dead skunk in the [G]middle of the road
[G]Dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
[C]Stinking to high [G]heaven

C'mon, stink

 [G] [D] [C] [G]
 [G] [D] [C] [G]You got it,



It's [G]dead.  [D]  It's in the middle.
[C]  Dead skunk in the [G]middle
[G]Dead skunk in the [D]middle of the road
[C]Stinking to high [G]heaven

[G]  [D]All over the road
[C]  [G]Technicolor
 [G] [D] [C] [G]

[G]     [D]     [C]   Oh, you got pol[G]lution.

And it's [C]stinkin' to high, high [G]heaven.
