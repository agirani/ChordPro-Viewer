[E]I wanna go home, 
I wanna go [A]home..
[E]oh, how I [B]wanna go [E]home.

[E]Last night I went to [B]sleep in Detroit [E]City.
And I [B]dreamed about those cotton fields and [E]home.
I [A]dreamed about my mother dear, old [E]papa, sister and brother.
I [Gb]dreamed about that girl who's been [B]waiting for so long.

I wanna go [E]home, 
I wanna go [A]home, 
[E]oh, how I [B]wanna go [E]home.

[B]Home folks think I'm [Gb]big in Detroit [B]City.
From the [Gb]letters that I write they think I'm [B]fine.
But by [E]day I make the cars, by [B]night I make the bars.
If [Db]only [Fb]they could [Db]read between the [Gb]lines.

[C]Cause you [Gb]know I rode the [B]freight train north to Detroit City.
And after all these [Gb]years I find I've just been [B]wastin' my time
So, I just [E]think I'll take my [A]foolish [E]pride..put it on a Southbound
[B]freight and ride.
And go on back to the [Db]loved ones, the ones that I left waitin'
so [Gb]far behind.

I wanna go [B]home, 
I wanna go [E]home, 
[B]oh, how I [Gb]wanna go [B]home.
