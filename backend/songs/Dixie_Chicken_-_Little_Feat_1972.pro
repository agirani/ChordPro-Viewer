Dixie Chicken chords(for the acoustic guitar)
Little Feat 1972 (Dixie Chicken) **

[A]              A
I've seen the bright lights of Memphis,
and the Commodore Ho[E]tel
And [E7]underneath a [E]street lamp, I met a [E7]southern [A]belle
Oh, she [D]took me to the [A]river, where she cast her [E]spell
And in that [E7]southern [E]moonlight, she sang this [E7]song so [A]well

If you'll [A]be my Dixie chicken I'll be your Tennessee [E]lamb
    E7            E              A  D * A
And we can walk together down in Dixie  land
E7      A  D * A
Down in Dixie  land

A . . . 

We made all the [A]hotspots, my money flowed like [E]wine
Then the [E7]low-down southern [E]whiskey, yea, began to [E7]fog my 
[A]mind
And I [D]don't remember [A]church bells, or the money I put [E]down
On the [E7]white picket fence and [E]boardwalk
On the [E7]house at the [E]end of [A]town
Oh, but [D]boy do I re[A]member the strain of her re[E]frain
And the [E7]nights we spent to[E]gether
And the [E7]way she [E]called my [A]name

If you'll [A]be my Dixie chicken I'll be your Tennessee [E]lamb
And [E7]we can walk to[E]gether down in [A]Dix[D]ie[A]land
[E7]Down in [A]Dix[D]ie[A]land

A . . .

Well, [A]many years since she ran away
Yes that guitar player sure could [E]play
She [E7]always liked to [E]sing along
She [E7]always [E]handy with a [A]song
But then [D]one night at the [A]lobby of the Commodore Ho[E]tel
I [E7]chanced to meet a [E]bartender who [E7]said he [E]knew her [A]well
And [D]as he handed [A]me a drink he began to hum a [E]song
And [E7]all the boys [E]there, at the bar, be[E7]gan to [E]sing a[A]long

If you'll [A]be my Dixie chicken I'll be your Tennessee [E]lamb
And [E7]we can walk to[E]gether down in [A]Dix[D]ie[A]land
[E7]Down in [A]Dix[D]ie[A]land
