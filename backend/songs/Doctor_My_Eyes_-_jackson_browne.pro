[E]Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow [G#m]parade of fears without c[C#m]rying
Now I w[A]ant to und[E]erstand
[E]I have done all that I could, to see the[G#m] evil and the good
without [C#m]hiding.  You must [A]help me if you [E]can

Doctor, my [C#m]eyes, [E]tell me what is wrong
Was I un[C#m]wise to leave them o[B]pen for so lon[A]g

 [E] [D/E] [A/E] [E]

'Cause I have [E]wandered through this world
And as each m[G#m]oment has unfurled,  I've been [C#m]waiting
to awak[A]en from these d[E]reams
[E]People go just where they will,  I never [G#m]noticed them until
I got this [C#m]feeling, that it's [A]later than it [E]seems

Doctor, my [C#m]eyes, [E]tell me what you see
I hear their [C#m]cries, just s[B]ay if it's too [D/E]late for[A] me

 [E] [D/E] [A/E] [E]
{c:repeat}

Doctor, my [C#m]eyes, they [E]cannot see the sky
Is this the [C#m]price for having [B]learned how not to [A]cry

 [E] [D/E] [A/E] [E]
