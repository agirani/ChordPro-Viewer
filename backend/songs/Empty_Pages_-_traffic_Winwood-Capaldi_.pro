{c:Verse 1  (Note E11 = D/E)}

[E]Found someon[A]e who can comf[E]ort me, b[E11]ut there are a[A]lways 
except[E]ions.
[E]And she's[A] good at appeari[E]ng sane, [E11]but I just wa[A]nt you to 
k[E]now.

{c:Verse 2 (same chords)}

She's the one makes me feel so good when everything is 
against me.
Picks me up when I'm feeling down, so I've got something 
to show.

{c:Chorus}
[D/A]Staring at em[C#m7/A]pty pages, si[C/A]nce you've go[D]ne[D] t[Em7]he s[D]ame old 
plot.

[D/A]Staring at [C#m7/A]empty pages, [C/A]flowing alo[D]ng[D] t[Em7]he a[D]ge[D]s [D] [Em7] [D]

{c:Verse 3 (Same chords)}
Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mirth
I've been thinking I'm working too hard, but I've got 
something to show

{c:Chorus (Same Chords)}

Staring at empty pages, centered 'round the same old plot.
Staring at empty pages, flowing along the ages.
