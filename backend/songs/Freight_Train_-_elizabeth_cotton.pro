[C]Freight train, freight train, [G7]goin' so fast,
[G]freight train, freight train, [C]goin' so fast
[E7]Please don't tell what [F]train I'm on,
so they [C]won't know [G7]where I'm [C]gone.

[C]Freight train, freight train, [G7]goin' round the bend,
[G]freight train, freight train, [C]comin' back again
[E7]One of these days turn that [F]train around,
and go [C]back to [G7]my home [C]town.

[C]One more place [G7]I'd like to be,
[G]one more place [C]I'd like to see
To [E7]watch them old Blue Ridge [F]Mountains climb,
when I [C]ride old [G7]Number [C]Nine.

[C]When I die Lord, [G7]bury me deep,
[G]down at the end of [C]Chestnut Street
[E7]Where I can hear old [F]Number Nine,
as [C]she comes [G7]down the [C]line.

[C]Freight train, freight train, [G7]goin' so fast,
[G]freight train, freight train, [C]goin' so fast
[E7]Please don't tell what [F]train I'm on,
so they [C]won't know [G7]where I'm [C]gone.
