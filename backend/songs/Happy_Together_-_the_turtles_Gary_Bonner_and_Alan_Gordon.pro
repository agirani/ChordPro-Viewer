Imagine [Em]me and you, I do
I think about you [D]day and night, it’s only right
To think about the [C]girl you love, and hold her tight
So happy to[B]gether
If I should [Em]call you up, invest a dime
And you say you be[D]long to me, and ease my mind
Imagine how the [C]world would be, so very fine
So happy to[B]gether

[E]I can't see me [Bm7]lovin’ nobody but [E]you, for all my [G]life
[E]When you’re with me [Bm7]baby, the skies will be [E]blue for all 
my [G]life

[Em]Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they [D]toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for [C]me is you, and you for me
So happy to[B]gether.
