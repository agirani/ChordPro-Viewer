 [D] [A]
{c:*  4x}

Did I [D]see you [A]down in a [G]young girl's [D]town,
with your mother in so much [A]pain?
I was [G]almost [A]there at the [Bm]top of the [E]stairs,
with her [D]screamin' in the [A]rain [D]

Did she [D]wake you [A]up to [G]tell you [D]that,
it was only a change of [A]plan?
[G]Dream up, dream [A]up, let me [Bm]fill your [E]cup,
with the [D]promise of a [A]man. [D]

Did I [D]see you [A]walking [G]with the [D]boys,
though it was not hand in [A]hand?
And was [G]some black [A]face in a [Bm]lonely [E]place,
when [D]you could under[A]stand? [D]

Did she [D]wake you [A]up to [G]tell you [D]that,
it was only a change of [A]plan?
[G]Dream up, dream [A]up, let me [Bm]fill your [E]cup,
with the [D]promise of a [A]man. [D]

Will I [D]see you [A]give more than [G]I can [D]take?
Will I only harvest [A]some?
As the [G]days fly [A]past will we [Bm]lose our [E]grasp,
or [D]fuse it in the [A]sun? [D]

Did she [D]wake you [A]up to [G]tell you [D]that,
it was only a change of [A]plan?
[G]Dream up, dream [A]up, let me [Bm]fill your [E]cup,
with the [D]promise of a [A]man. [D]

[G]Dream up, dream [A]up, let me [Bm]fill your [E]cup,
with the [D]promise of a [A]man. [D]
