[E]Somebody's gonna [C#m]hurt someone  [E]
before the night is [C#m]through 
[E]Somebody's gonna [A]come undone. [E]
There's nothin' we can [B]do. 
[E]Everybody wants to [C#m]touch somebody  [E]
if it takes all [C#m]night. 
[E]Everybody wants to [A]take a little chance,  [E]
Make it come out [B]right. 

[E]There's gonna be a [A7]heartache tonight, 
a heartache tonight, I [E]know.[E7] 
There's gonna be a [A7]heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I [F#]know. 
Lord, I [B]know. 

[E]Some people like to [C#m]stay out late  [E]
Some folks can't hold out that [C#m]long 
But [E]nobody wants to [A]go home now,  [E]
there's too much goin' [B]on. 

[E]This night is gonna [C#m]last forever,[E] 
Last all, last all summer [C#m]long. 
[E]Some time before the [A]sun comes up  [E]
The radio is gonna [B]play that song. 

[E]There's gonna be a [A7]heartache tonight, 
a heartache tonight, I [E]know. 
There's gonna be a [A7]heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I [F#]know. 
Lord, I [B]know. 

There's gonna be a [E]heartache tonight, 
the [E7]moon's shinin' bright 
so [A]turn out the light, and [A7]we'll get it right. 
There's gonna be a [E]heartache tonight, a 
[A7]heartache tonight I [E]know. 

(Heartache baby)
