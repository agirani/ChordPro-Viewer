[Am]Here comes the rain again
[F]Falling on my head like a memory,
[G]Falling on my head like a new e[Am]motion.

[Am]I want to walk in the open wind.
[F]I want to talk like lovers do.
[G]I want to dive into your ocean.
Is it [Am]raining with you?

So baby, [F]talk to me
Like [C]lovers do.
[F]Walk with me
Like [C]lovers do.
[F]Talk to me
Like [C]lovers do[D]. [G]

[Am]Here comes the rain again-
[F]Raining in my head like a tragedy,
[G]Tearing me apart like a new e[Am]motion.
[Am]I want to breathe in the open wind.
[F]I want to kiss like lovers do.
[G]I want to dive into your ocean.
Is it [Am]raining with you?

So baby, [F]talk to me
Like [C]lovers do.
[F]Walk with me
Like [C]lovers do.
[F]Talk to me
Like [C]lovers do[D]. [G]

 [Em] [F] [Am]
 [Em] [F] [G]

So baby, [F]talk to me
Like [C]lovers do[D]. [G]

 [Am] [F] [G] [Am]
[Am]   Here it [F]comes again
[G]Hooo-oooh, [Am]hey hey hey hey he-ey yeah

[Am]Here comes the rain again-
[F]Falling on my head like a memory,
[G]Falling on my head like a new e[Am]motion.

Here it goes again, here it goes again.

[Am]I want to walk in the open wind.
[F]I want to talk like lovers do.
[G]I want to dive into your ocean.
Is it [Am]raining with you?

[Am]Here comes the rain again-
[F]falling on my head like a memory,
[G]falling on my head like a new e[Am]motion.

[Am]I want to walk in the open wind.
[F]I want to talk like lovers do.
[G]I want to dive into your ocean.
Is it [Am]raining with you?

[Am]Here comes the rain again-
[F]Falling on my head like a memory,
[G]Falling on my head like a new emotion.
