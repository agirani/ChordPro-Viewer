[Em] She [A6]was a [Am/D]working girl
[Cm] North of England [G]way
[Em]Now she's [A6]hit the [Am/D]big time
[Cm] In the U.S.[G]A.
And [A7]if she could only hear me
[D7]This is what I'd say

[G]Honey pie, you are making me [Eb7]crazy
[E7]I'm in love but I'm [A7]lazy
[D7]So won't you please come [G]home[Eb7][D7]

Oh [G]honey pie, my position is [Eb7]tragic
[E7]Come and show me the [A7]magic
[D7]of your Hollywood [G]song[F#][F]

[Em]You became a [C#m7b5]legend of the [G]silver screen[G7]
And now the [C]thought of meeting you
[E7]Makes me weak in the [Am]knee[D7]

Oh [G]honey pie, you are driving me [Eb7]frantic
[E7]Sail across the At[A7]lantic
[D7]To be where you be[G]long, honey [Eb7]pie come [D7]back to me

{c:Instrumental (same as verse)
}|G    |G    |Eb7  |E7   |A7   |D7   |G
I like it like [Eb7]that,[D7] ooh

[G]I like this kind of hot kind of [Eb7]music
[E7]Hot kind of music
[A7]Just play it to me
[D7]Play it to me Hollywood [G]Blues[F#][F]

[Em]Will the wind that [C#m7b5]blew her boat
A[G]cross the sea[G7]
[C]Kindly send her [E7]sailing back to [Am]me[D7]

[G]Honey pie, you are making me [Eb7]crazy
[E7]I'm in love but I'm [A7]lazy
[D7]So won't you please come [G]home
Come, come back to [Eb7]me honey [D7]pie
