There's no st[C]ronger wind than the [F]one that blows down a lonesome railroad [C]line
No prettier sight than lookin' back at a t[D7]own you left beh[G]ind [G7]
But there's n[C]othin' that's as real as the l[F]ove that's in my [C]mind.

[G]Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The [F]Mornin'
[G]Close your eyes I'll [F]be here for awhi[Am]le. [G] [G7]

There's [C]lots of things a[F]long the road I'd surely like to[C] see
I'd like to lean into the wind and t[D7]ell myself I'm f[G]ree [G7]
But your so[C]ftest whispers louder than the hi[F]ghway's call to [C]me

[G]Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The [F]Mornin'
[G]Close your eyes I'll [F]be here for awhi[Am]le. [G] [G7]

All the [C]mountains and the rivers and the[F] valleys can't co[C]mpare
To your bluely dancin' eyes and y[D7]ellow shinin' ha[G]ir [G7]
I could nev[C]er hit the open road and le[F]ave you lyin' th[C]ere

[G]Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The [F]Mornin'
[G]Close your eyes I'll [F]be here for awhi[Am]le. [G] [G7]

Aw [C]lay your head back e[F]asy love and close your cryin' e[C]yes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the [D7]sun comes on the r[G]ise [G7]
And I'll st[C]ay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lon[F]esome Blue Jay c[C]ries.

[G]Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The [F]Mornin'
[G]Close your eyes I'll [F]be here for awhi[Am]le
[G]Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The [F]Mornin'
[G]Close your eyes I'll [F]be here for awhi[Am]le
