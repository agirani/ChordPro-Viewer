This song was played by Joe Brown on a ukulele, at the George Harrison memorial
concert,so this is written with the ukulele in mind, chords with numbers in brackets 
should be
played in the chords 2nd, or 3rd etc position going up the frets.This maybe different on 
a guitar, but should be very similar as they intend to give chord riffs.
