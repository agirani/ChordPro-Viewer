    Babe, I’d lay awake all night
B A              E
    Wait for the mornin’ light
A            G#m
 To shine in through

 But it would not be new

 If not for you
E
 My sky would fall
B                  E
 Rain would gather too
A                         E
 Without your love I’d be nowhere at all
F#                     B
I’d be lost if not for you
        A         G#m    F#m 
And you know it’s true

    Winter would have no spring
B A                   E
    Couldn’t hear the robin sing
A                       G#m
 I just wouldn’t have a clue
F#m                      G#m
 Anyway it wouldn’t ring true
