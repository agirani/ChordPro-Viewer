It's not the [Em/A]long flowing d[Bm]ress that you're i[C]n
Or the l[Em/A]ight coming [Bm]off of your s[C]kin
The fragile h[Em/A]eart you protected for so l[G]ong
Or the m[Em/A]ercy in your sense of right and wr[G]ong [Dsus4]

It's not your h[Em/A]ands, searching s[Bm]low in the d[C]ark
Or your n[Em/A]ails leaving l[Bm]ove's waterma[C]rk
It's not the [Em/A]way you talk me off the ro[G]of
Your q[Em/A]uestions like directions to the tru[G]th [Dsus4]

It's k[C]nowing that this can't go on fore[G]ver
Lik[C]ely one of us will have to sp[G]end some days a[Dsus4]lone
Ma[C]ybe we'll get forty years toge[Em/A]ther
Bu[Dsus4]t one day I'll be go[C]ne or one day you'll be [Em/A]gone [Dsus4]

If we were va[Em/A]mpires and d[Bm]eath was a jo[C]ke
We'd go [Em/A]out on the sid[Bm]ewalk and sm[C]oke
And l[Em/A]augh at all the lovers and their pl[G]ans
I w[Em/A]ouldn't feel the need to hold your ha[G]nd [Dsus4]

Maybe t[Em/A]ime running [Bm]out is a g[C]ift
I'll work h[Em/A]ard 'til the [Bm]end of my shi[C]ft
To [Em/A]give you every second I can f[G]ind
 And [Em/A]hope it isn't me whoâ€™s left behi[G]nd [Dsus4]

It's k[C]nowing that this can't go on fore[G]ver
Lik[C]ely one of us will have to sp[G]end some days a[Dsus4]lone
Ma[C]ybe we'll get forty years toge[Em/A]ther
Bu[Dsus4]t one day I'll be go[C]ne or one day you'll be [Em/A]gone [Dsus4]
