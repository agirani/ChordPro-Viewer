G            C#m7-5/G
  Isn't it a pity
Cmaj7/G           G
  Now, isn't it a shame
G                          Gdim7
 How we break each other's hearts
C6/G                   G
  And cause each other pain
G                         A7
 How we take each other's love
C                    G
 Without thinking anymore
G                    Gdim7
  Forgetting to give back
C6/G         G
  Isn't it a pity




G                     C#m7-5/G
  Some things take so long
Cmaj7/G          G
  But how do I explain
G                   Gdim7
  When not too many people
C6/G                    G
  Can see we're all the same
G                         A7
 And because of all their tears
C                          G
  Their eyes can't hope to see
G                    Gdim7
  The beauty that surrounds them
C6/G         G
  Isn't it a pity

Na, na , na, na - isn't it a pity
