Oh[D] lord, it's hard to be humble,
When you're perfect in every [A7]way,
I [A7]can't wait to look in the mirror,
I get better looking each [D]day.
To [D]know me is to love me,
I m[D7]ust be a hell of a ma[G]n,
Oh lord it's hard to be [D]humble,
But I'm [A]doing the best that I [D]can.

I[D] used to have a girlfriend,
But I guess she just couldn't com[A7]pete,
With a[A7]ll of these love starved women,
Who keep clamoring at my [D]feet.
Well I [D]prob'ly could find me another,
But I [D7]guess they're all in awe of [G]me,
Who cares, I never get [D]lonesome.
'Cause I [A7]treasure my own compa[D]ny.

Oh[D] lord, it's hard to be humble,
When you're perfect in every [A7]way,
I [A7]can't wait to look in the mirror,
I get better looking each [D]day.
To [D]know me is to love me,
I mu[D7]st be a hell of a ma[G]n,
Oh lord it's hard to be [D]humble,
We're [A7]doing the best that we [D]can.

I[D] guess you could say I'm a loner,
A cowboy outlaw tough and [A7]proud,
I could [A7]have lots of friends if I wanted,
But then I wouldn't stand out from the [D]crowd.
Some [D]folks say that I'm egotistical,
Hell, I do[D7]n't even know what that [G]means,
I guess it has something to [D]do with the way 
That I [A7]fill out my skin tight blue [D]jeans.

Oh[D] lord, it's hard to be humble,
When you're perfect in every [A7]way,
I [A7]can't wait to look in the mirror,
I get better looking each [D]day.
To [D]know me is to love me,
I [D7]must be a hell of a [G]man,
Oh lord it's hard to be [D]humble,
But we're [A7]doing the best that we [D]can. 

But we're [A7]doing the best that we [D]can.
