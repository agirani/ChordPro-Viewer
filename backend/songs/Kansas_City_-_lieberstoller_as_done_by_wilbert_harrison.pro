[A]With my [E7]Kansas City baby,
And a [D7]bottle of Kansas City [A]wine.

[A]Well I might take a train, / I might take a plane, / but if I have to walk / I'm going just the same, 
I'm going [D]to Kansas City, Kansas City here I [A]come
They got some [E7]crazy little women there and [D7]I'm gonna get me [A]one.

[A]If I stay with that woman, I know I'm going to die
                                                       
Have to find a friendly baby, that's the reason why

[A]They got some [E7]crazy little women there,
And [D7]I'm gonna get me [A]some.  [A]
