Now she's [Em]walking through the [G]clouds
With a [Am]circus mind that's running[Em] wild
[Bm]Butterflies and zebras [Bbm7]and mo[Am]onbeams, and fairy [C]tales
[G]All she ever [F]thinks about [C]is [D]

Riding with the wind

{c:(Itâ€™s the same chords through the whole song})

When I'm[Em] sad she comes to[G] me
With a t[Am]housand smiles she gives to me [Em]free
[Bm]It's alright, it's alrigh[Bbm7]t she says [Am]
Take a[C]nything you [G]want from m[F]e
[C]Anything [D]

[Em]        [G]  Fly little wing..[Am].
