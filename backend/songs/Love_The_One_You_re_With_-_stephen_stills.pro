And [D]don't sit [G/D]cryi[D]ng over good times you've [Em/D]had [D]
[D]There's a [G/D]girl [D]  right next to [Em/D]you [D]
And [D]she's just [G/D]wait[D]ing for something to [Em/D]do [D]

Well there's a [Bm]rose[A] in a fisted g[G]love
And the [Bm]eagle fl[A]ies with t[G]he dove
And if you c[Bm]an't be [A]with the one you [G]love, honey
Love the one you're w[D]ith [G/D] [D]
You gotta lo[D]ve the on[Em/D]e you're [D]with
You gotta lo[D]ve the one yo[G/D]u're [D]with
You gotta lo[D]ve the on[Em/D]e you're [D]with
