 [G] [Gmaj7] [C] [Am] [D7] [G]

[G]City girls just [Gmaj7]seem to find out [C]early,
[Am]how to open doors with just a [D7]smile.
A [G]rich old man and [Gmaj7]she won't have to [C]worry;
she'll [Am]dress up all in [C]lace and go in [G]style.

[G]Late at night a [Gmaj7]big old house gets [C]lonely;
I guess [Am]every form of refuge has its [D7]price.
And it [G]breaks her heart to [Gmaj7]think her love is [C]only
Given [Am]to a man with [C]hands as cold as [G]ice. [C] [D]

So she [G]tells him she must [Gmaj7]go out for the [C]evening
To c[Am]omfort an old friend who's feeling [D7]down.
But [G]he knows where she's [Gmaj7]goin' as she's [C]leavin';
She's [Am]headed for the [C]cheatin' side of [G]town. [C] [G]

You can't [G]hi-  [C]ide your lyin' [G]eyes, [C]   [G]   and your [Em]smi - 
[Bm]ile is a thin dis[Am]guise. [D]
I thought by [G]no - [F/G]ow     you'd rea-[C]li - [A7]ize there [Am]ain't no 
way to [D]hide your lying [G]eyes.

 [G] [Gmaj7] [C] [Am] [D7] [G]

On the [G]other side of [Gmaj7]town a boy is [C]waiting
with [Am]fiery eyes and dreams no one could [D7]steal
She [G]drives on through the [Gmaj7]night, antici-[C]pating
Cos he [Am]makes her feel the [C]way she used to [G]feel [C] [D]

She [G]rushes to his [Gmaj7]arms, they fall to-[C]gether
She [Am]whispers that it's only for a [D7]while
She [G]swears that soon she'll be [Gmaj7]coming back for-[C]ever
She [Am]pulls away and [C]leaves him with a [G]smile

You can't [G]hi-  [C]ide your lyin' [G]eyes, [C]   [G]   and your 
[Em]smi-i-[Bm]ile is a thin dis[Am]guise. [D]
I thought by [G]no - [F/G]ow     you'd rea-[C]li - [A7]ize there [Am]ain't no 
way to [D]hide your lying [G]eyes.

 [G] [Gmaj7] [C] [Am] [D7] [G]

[G]She gets up and [Gmaj7]pours herself a [C]strong one
And [Am]stares out at the stars up in the [D7]sky.
A[G]nother night, it's [Gmaj7]gonna be a [C]long one;
She [Am]draws the shade and [C]hangs her head to [G]cry. [C] [D]

She [G]wonders how it [Gmaj7]ever got this [C]crazy
She [Am]thinks about a boy she knew in [D7]school
Did [G]she get tired or [Gmaj7]did she just get [C]lazy
She's [Am]so far gone, she [C]feels just like a [G]fool [C] [D]

[G]My, oh my, you [Gmaj7]sure know how to ar-[C]range things;
You [Am]set it up so well, so careful-[D7]ly.
Ain't it [G]funny how your [Gmaj7]new life didn't [C]change things;
You're [Am]still the same old [C]girl you used to [G]be. [C] [G]

You can't [G]hi-  [C]ide your lyin' [G]eyes, [C]   [G]   and your [Em]smi-i- 
[Bm]ile is a thin dis-[Am]guise. [D]
I thought by [G]no - [F/G]ow     you'd rea-[C]li - [A7]ize there [Am]ain't no 
way to [D]hide your lying [G]eyes.
[Gmaj7]There [Am]ain't no way to [D]hide your lyin' [G]eyes
[Gmaj7]  [Am]Honey, you can't [D]hide your lyin' [G]eyes.

 [G] [Gmaj7] [Am] [D] [G]
