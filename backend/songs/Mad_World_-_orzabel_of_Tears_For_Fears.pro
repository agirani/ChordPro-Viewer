{c:Hey, I have changed the key of this piece a minor third up from where it’s}
{c:usually written as. It’s easier to play and I personally find it easier to sing to...}

[Am]All around me are fa[C]miliar faces
[G]Worn out places, [D]worn out faces
[Am]Bright and early for their [C]daily races
[G]Going nowhere, [D]going nowhere
[Am]And their tears are filling [C]up their glasses
[G]No expression, [D]no expression
[Am]Hide my head; I want to [C]drown my sorrow
[G]No tomorrow, [D]no tomorrow

[Am]   And I find it kind of [D]funny
I find it kind of [Am]sad
The dreams in which I'm [D]dying
Are the best I've ever [Am]had
I find it hard to [D]tell you,
'cause I find it hard to [Am]take
When people run in [D]circles it's a very, very...

[Am]Children waiting for the [C]day they feel good
[G]Happy birthday, [D]happy birthday
[Am]Made to feel the way that [C]every child should
[G]Sit and listen, [D]sit and listen
[Am]Went to school and I was [C]very nervous
[G]No one knew me, [D]no one knew me
[Am]Hello, teacher tell me [C]what's my lesson?
[G]Look right through me, [D]look right through me

[Am]And I find it kind of [D]funny
I find it kind of [Am]sad
The dreams in which I'm [D]dying
Are the best I've ever [Am]had
I find it hard to [D]tell you,
'cause I find it hard to [Am]take
When people run in [D]circles it's a very, very...
