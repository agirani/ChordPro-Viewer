[E] [F#m] [G#m] [F#m]

[E]Crossroads, [F#m]seem to come and [G#m]go,       [F#m]yeah. 
[E]The gypsy [F#m]flies from coast to [G#m]coast [F#m]
[A]Knowing [Bm]many, [C#m]loving [D]none,
[E]Bearing [F#m]sorrow [G#m]havin'  [A]fun, 
[Cmaj7]But back home he'll always [B]run to sweet melis[E]sa... mmm...  [F#m] [G#m] [F#m]

[E]Freight train, [F#m]each car looks the [G#m]same, all the [F#m]same. 
[E]And no [F#m]one [G#m]knows the [F#m]gypsy's [E]name
[A]No one [Bm]hears his [C#m]lonely [D]sigh, 
[E]There are [F#m]no blankets [G#m]where he [G#m]lies. [A]
[Cmaj7]In all his deepest dreams [B]the gypsy flies 
with sweet melis[E]sa... mmm... [F#m] [G#m] [F#m]
 
{soc}
[E]Again the morning’s come,
[D]Again he’s on the run,
[A]Sunbeams shining through his hair,
[B]Appearing not to have a care.
[C#m]Well, pick up your gear and gypsy roll on, roll on. [A] [B]
{eoc}

[E]Crossroads,[F#m] will you ever let him g[G#m]o? (lord, l[F#m]ord)
[E]Will you hide the dead ma[F#m]n's ghost,
[A]Or will he [Bm]lie, beneath the c[C#m]lay, [D]
[E]Or will his spi[F#m]rit roll away[G#m]?  [A]
[Cmaj7]But I know that he won't stay w[B]ithout melissa. [E] [F#m]
[Cmaj7][F#m][B] [E] [F#m] [G#m]
Yes I know that he won't stay without melissa
