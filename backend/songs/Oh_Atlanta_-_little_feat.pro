They got a [F]place down Kentucky 
[C]Right down near Ohio 
Where [G]you can watch the planes at night 
[Am]People [Bb]line [C]up to watch each flight 
I said [Am]watchin' [Bb]them [C]planes 
I [Am]wish I [Bb]was [C]on one 
I'm [Am]sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my [E7]red head dream 
If I could [F7]on - [Bb]ly [Eb]see her [E]to - [F]night 

[F]Oh Atlanta, [C]Oh Atl[F]anta!

Well you can [F]drop me off on Peachtree 
I got to [C]feel that Georgia sun 
And the [G]women there in Atlanta 
They make you [Am]aw - [Bb]fully [C]glad you come 
I said [Am]watchin' [Bb]them [C]planes 
I [Am]wish I [Bb]was [C]on one 
I'm [Am]sittin' here thinking 'bout my [E7]crazy dream 
If I could [F7]on - [Bb]ly be [Eb]there [E]to - [F]night

They got the [C]boogie band blowin' that's bound for hell 

And when they get to movin' they never stop 
You just [F]keep on playin' that down home beat 

You just keep on layin' it down hot
