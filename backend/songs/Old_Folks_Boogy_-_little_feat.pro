[C7]Off Our Rockers, Actin' [F7]Crazy
[C7]With the Right Medication We Won't Be Lazy

[C7]Doin' the Old Folk[F7]s Boogie
And Boo[Ab7]gie We Will
'cause [G7]to Us the Thought's As Good As a Thrill

[C7]Back At the Home,
[F7]No Time Is Your Own,
[C7]Facillities There, They're All Out On Loan
[F7]The Bank Forclose, and Your Bankruptcy Sh[Ab7]ows
[C7]And Your Credit Creeps to An All-time Low

[G7]So You Know, That You're Over the Hi[F7]l
[C7]When Your Mind Makes a[Bb] Promise 
[A]Tha[Bb]t Your Body[A] Can[Bb]'t Fil[A]l.
