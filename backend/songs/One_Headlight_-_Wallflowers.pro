 [G] [D] [F#7] [Bm] [A]

[G]So long ago, I don't re[D]member when
That's [F#7]when they say I lost my only [Bm]friend [A]
Well they [G]said she died easy of a [D]broken heart disease
As I [F#7]listened through the cemetery [Bm]trees [A]

 [G] [D] [F#7] [Bm] [A]

I seen the [G]sun comin' up at the f[D]uneral at dawn
The [F#7]long broken arm of human [Bm]law [A]
Now it [G]always seemed such a waste she [D]always had a pretty face
I [F#7]wondered how she hung around this [Bm]place [A]

[G] [G] [F#7]Hey [F#7]

[G]   Come on try a little
[D]   Nothing is forever
[Em7]   Got to be something [A]better than
           
   In the middle
[G]   Me & Cinderella
[D]   Put it all together
   [Em7]We can drive it h[A]ome [A7sus4]
   With one head[G]light

 [G] [D] [F#7] [Bm] [A]

She said it's [G]cold
It feels like Inde[D]pendence Day
And I [F#7]can't break away from this pa[Bm]rade [A]
But there's [G]got to be an opening
[D]Somewhere here in front of me
[F#7]Through this maze of ugliness and [Bm]greed [A]
And I seen the [G]sun up ahead
At the [D]county line bridge
Sayin' [F#7]all there's good and nothingness is [Bm]dead [A]
We'll [G]run until she's out of breath
She [D]ran until there's nothin' left
She [F#7]hit the end-it's just her window [Bm]ledge [A]

[G] [G]  [F#7]Hey [F#7]hey

[G]   Come on try a little
[D]   Nothing is forever
[Em7]   Got to be something [A]better than
           
   In the middle
[G]   Me & Cinderella
[D]   Put it all together
   [Em7]We can drive it h[A]ome [A7sus4]
   With one head[G]light

 [G] [D] [F#7] [Bm] [A]
 [G] [D] [F#7] [Bm] [A]

Well this place is [G]old
It feels just like a [D]beat up truck
I turn the [F#7]engine, but the engine doesn't [Bm]turn [A]
Well it smells of [G]cheap wine & cigarettes
This [D]place is always such a mess
Some[F#7]times I think I'd like to watch it [Bm]burn [A]
I'm so a[G]lone, and I feel just like some[D]body else
Man, I ain't [F#7]changed, but I know I ain't the [Bm]same [A]
But s[G]omewhere here in between the [D]city walls of dyin' dreams
I [F#7]think her death it must be killin' [Bm]me [A]

[G]  [G]  [F#7]Hey hey [F#7]hey

[G]   Come on try a little
[D]   Nothing is forever
[Em7]   Got to be something [A]better than
           
   In the middle
[G]   Me & Cinderella
[D]   Put it all together
[Em7]   We can drive it home
[A]   Wit[A7sus4]h one head[G]li[D]gh[Em7]t [A]
