 [Em] [Cmaj7] [Am] [Em] [Bm]

One of these [Em]nights, one of these [Cmaj7]crazy old [Em]nights  
we're gonna [Am]find out, pretty mama, what turns [Em]on your lights
The [Em]full moon is calling, the [D6]fever is high
and the [Cmaj7]wicked wind whispers and moans,
[Am]you got your demons, you got your desires,
well, [Em]I got a few of my [Bm]own.

[Cmaj7]Ooh, someone to be kind to [G]in between the darkness and light.
[Cmaj7]Ooh, coming right behind you, [Am]swear I'm gonna find you 
[Bm]One of these Nights.

One of these [Em]dreams, one of these [Cmaj7]lost and lonely [Em]dreams
we are gonna [Am]find a girl, one that [Em]really screams
I've been [Em]searchin' for the daughter of the [D6]devil himself
I've been [Cmaj7]searchin' for an angel in white.
I've been [Am]waitin' for a woman who's a little of both
and I can [Em]feel her but she's nowhere in [Bm]sight.

[Cmaj7]Ooh, loneliness will bind you [G]in between the wrong and the right
[Cmaj7]Ooh, coming right behind you, [Am]swear I'm gonna find you
[Bm]One of these Nights....

One of these [Cmaj7]nights 
[G]In between the dark and the light 
[Em]Coming right behind you 
[Cmaj7]Swear I'm gonna find you 
[G]Get 'ya baby one of these nights 

One of these [Cmaj7]nights   ooh ooh [G]ooh
One of these [Cmaj7]nights 
I can [Em]feel it 
I can [G]feel it 

One of these [Cmaj7]nights 
[G]Coming right behind you 
                         
Swear I'm gonna find you now 
One of these [Cmaj7]nights...
