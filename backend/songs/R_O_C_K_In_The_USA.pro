Very easy - the basic chord pattern is  E A D A (open chords)
Generally, the strumming pattern (I think) is two downstrokes on
the beat for each chord and then change to the next chord with
an upstroke on the change.

The only exceptions are replacing the E chord of the sequence
with a B chord at the end of the chorus.  Also, use only a single downstroke
and no upstroke in the first verse for each word in “crack, boom, bam”.

Anyway, it goes something like this:
