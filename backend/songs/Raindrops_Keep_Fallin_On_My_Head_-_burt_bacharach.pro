 [F] [C] [Bb] [C]

Raindrops keep[Fmaj7] falling on my head
And [F7]just like the guy whose feet are [Bb]too big for his [Am]bed,
[D7]Nothing seems to [Am]fit, [D7]those [Gm7]raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep falli[Bb]n' [C]

So I just [F]did me some talkin' to the [Fmaj7]sun,
And [F7]I said I didn't like the w[Bb]ay he got things do[Am]ne
Sl[D7]eepin' on the j[Am]ob, t[D7]hose [Gm7]raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep falli[Bb]n'

But there's [C]one [F]thing I [Fmaj7]know,
The [Bb]blues they send to [C]meet me, won't [Am7]defeat me
It won't be long till [D7]happiness steps [Gm7]up to greet me [Bb/C] [C] [Bb/C] [C]

[F]Raindrops keep fallin' on my [Fmaj7]head,
But [F7]that doesn't mean my eyes will [Bb]soon be turnin' [Am]red,
[D7]Cryin's not for [Am]me, [D7]cause [Gm7]I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' [Bb]
Be[C]cause I'm f[F]ree, n[Gm7]othing's worryin' [F]me

It w[Am]on't be long till [D7]happiness steps [Gm7]up to greet me [Bb] [C] [Bb] [C]

[F]Raindrops keep fallin' on my [Fmaj7]head,
But [F7]that doesn't mean my eyes will [Bb]soon be turnin' [Am]red,
[D7]Cryin's not for [Am]me, [D7]cause [Gm7]I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' [C7]
Because I'm [F]free, [Gm7]nothing's worryin' [F]me
