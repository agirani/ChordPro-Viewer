Now, [G]red solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And [Am]you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If [D]you prefer drinkin' from [G]glass
Hey, [G]red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years, they are decomposable
And [Am]unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
[D]Freddy mac can kiss my [G]ass

Whoo!

[G]Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a [Am]party
Let's have a [D]party
I love you, [G]red solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to [Am]party
Proceed to [D]party

Now, [G]I really love how you're easy to stack

But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when [Am]beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, [D]that, my friends, is quite [G]yucky
But [G]I have to admit that the ladies get smitten

Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On [Am]you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On [D]them to help me get [G]lucky

[G]Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a [Am]party
Let's have a [D]party
I love you, [G]red solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to [Am]party
Proceed to [D]party

Now, I've [G]seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow

But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause [Am]you are the Abbot to my Costello
And [D]you are the Fruit to my [G]Loom
[G]Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic

You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And [Am]believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When [D]I look at you and [D7]say

N.C.
Red solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend x3; Life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

[A]Red solo cup

I fill you up
Let's have a [Bm]party
Let's have a [E]party
I love you, [A]red solo cup

I lift you up
Proceed to [Bm]party
Proceed to [E]party
