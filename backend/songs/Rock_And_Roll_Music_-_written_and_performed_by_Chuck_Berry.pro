        Just let me hear some of that

[Intro]
A7

N.C.
Just let me hear some of that

[Chorus]
D
Rock and roll music any old way you choose it
           G
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
D
Any old time you use it
     A7
It's gotta be rock and roll music
                        D
If you wanna dance with me
A7                      D
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
N.C.                   A7
I have no kick against modern jazz
                           D
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
                             G
And change the beauty of the melody
                            A7
Until it sounds just like a symphony
N.C.
That's why I go for that

[Chorus]
D
Rock and roll music any old way you choose it
           G
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
D
Any old time you use it
A7
Gotta be rock roll music
                        D
If you wanna dance with me
A7                      D
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 2]
N.C.                     A7
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
                           D
So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
                        G
I must admit they had a rockin' band
                              A7
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
N.C.
That's why I go for that

[Chorus]
D
Rock and roll music any old way you choose it
           G
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
D
Any old time you use it
A7
Gotta be rock roll music
                        D
If you wanna dance with me
A7                      D
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 3]
N.C.                       A7
Way down south they gave a jubilee
                               D
Them Georgia folks, they had a jamboree
                                  G
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
                      A7
The folks dancin' got all shook up
N.C.
And started playin' that

[Chorus]
D
Rock and roll music any old way you choose it
           G
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
D
Any old time you use it
A7
Gotta be rock roll music
                        D
If you wanna dance with me
A7                      D
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 4]
N.C.                          A7
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
                         D
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
                           G
It's way too early for the congo
                         A7
So keep a-rockin' that piano
N.C.
So I can hear some of that

[Chorus]
D
Rock and roll music any old way you choose it
           G
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
D
Any old time you use it
A7
Gotta be rock roll music
                        D
If you wanna dance with me
A7                      D
If you wanna dance with me

[Outro]
D6
