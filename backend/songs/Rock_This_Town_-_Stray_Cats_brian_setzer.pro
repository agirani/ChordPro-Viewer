 [D]

Well, my [D]baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so [A7]right
Well, [D]pick you up at ten, gotta [D7]have you home at two
[G]Mama don't know what I [G7]got in store for you
But [D]that's all right 'cause we're [A7]looking as cool as can [D]be

Well, we [D]found a little place that really didn't look half bad
I had a whiskey on the rocks and change of a dollar for the [A7]jukebox
Well, I [D]put a quarter right in[D7]to that can
But [G]all it played was [G7]disco, man
Come [D]on, pretty baby, let's [A7]get out of here right a[D]way

We're gonna [D]rock this town, rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town, make 'em scream and [A7]shout
Let's [D]rock, rock, rock, man, [D7]rock
We're gonna [G]rock 'til we pop, we're gonna [G7]rock 'til we drop
We're gonna [D]rock this town, [A7]rock it inside [D]out

Well, we're [D]having a ball just a-bopping on the big dance floor
Well, there's a real square cat, he looks like 197[A7]4
Well, he [D]look at me once, he look at me [D7]twice
Look at me ag[G]ain and there's a-[G7]gonna be fight
We're gonna [D]rock this town, we're gonna [A7]rip this place a[D]part

We're gonna [D]rock this town, rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town, make 'em scream and [A7]shout
Let's [D]rock, rock, rock, man, [D7]rock
We're gonna [G]rock 'til we pop, we're gonna [G7]rock 'til we drop
We're gonna [D]rock this town, [A7]rock it inside [D]out
We're gonna [D]rock this town, [A7]rock it inside [D]out
We're gonna [D]rock this town, [A7]rock it inside [D]out
