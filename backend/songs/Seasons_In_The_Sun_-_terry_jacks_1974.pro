[G]Goodbye to you my t[D]rusted [G]friend
We've known each other since we were n[Am]ine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and [G]trees
Learned of love and AB[Am]C's
Skinned our [D]hearts and skinned our[G] knees

[G]Goodbye my friend it's [D]hard to [G]die
When all the birds are singing [Am]in the sky
Now that spring is in the[G] air
Pretty girls are every[Am]where
[D]Think of me and I'll be[G] there

[D]We had [G]joy we had fun we had [Am]seasons in the sun
But the [D]hills that we climbed were just seasons out of[G] time

[G]Goodbye papa, please [D]pray for m[G]e
I was the black sheep of the fa[Am]mily
You've tried to teach me right from[G] wrong
Too much wine and too much [Am]song
[D]Wonder how I got a[G]long

[G]Goodbye papa it's [D]hard to d[G]ie
When all the birds are singing [Am]in the sky
Now that spring is in the[G] air
Little children ever[Am]ywhere
[D]When you see them I'll be [G]there

[D]We had [G]joy we had fun we had [Am]seasons in the sun
But the [D]wine and the song like the seasons have all [G]gone
[D]We had [G]joy we had fun we had [Am]seasons in the sun
But the [D]wine and the song like the seasons have all [G]gone

[G]Goodbye Michelle my l[D]ittle o[G]ne
You gave me love and helped me [Am]find the sun
And every time that I was[G] down
You would always come [Am]around
[D]And get my feet back on the [G]ground

[G]Goodbye Michelle it's h[D]ard to d[G]ie
When all the birds are singing [Am]in the sky
Now that spring is in the[G] air
With the flowers every[Am]where
[D]I wish that we could both be [G]there
