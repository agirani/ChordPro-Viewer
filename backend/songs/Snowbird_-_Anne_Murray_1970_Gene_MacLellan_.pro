 [G] [Bm] [Am] [D] [D7] [G]

Be[G]neath it's snowy [Bm]mantle cold and [Am]clean,
The [D]unborn grass lies waiting for its [D7]coat to turn to [G]green.
The [G]snowbird sings the [Bm]song he always [Am]sings,
And [D]speaks to me of flowers that will [D7]bloom again in [G]spring. 

When [G]I was young my [Bm]heart was young then, [Am]too.
And [D]anything that it would tell me, that's the [D7]thing that I would [G]do.
But [G]now I feel such [Bm]emptiness with[Am]in,
For the [D]thing that I want most in life's the [D7]thing that I can't [G]win.

[G]Spread your tiny [Bm]wings and fly a[Am]way,
And [D]take the snow back with you where it [D7]came from on that [G]day.
The [G]one I love for[Bm]ever is un[Am]true,
And [D]if I could you know that I would [D7]fly away with [G]you.

The [G]breeze along the [Bm]river seems to [Am]say,
That he'll [D]only break my heart again should [D7]I decide to [G]stay.
So, little [G]snowbird, take me [Bm]with you when you [Am]go
To that [D]land of gentle breezes where the [D7]peaceful waters [G]flow.

[G]Spread your tiny [Bm]wings and fly a[Am]way,
And [D]take the snow back with you where it [D7]came from on that [G]day.
The [G]one I love for[Bm]ever is un[Am]true,
And [D]if I could you know that I would [D7]fly away with [G]you.

Yeah, [D]if I could I know that I would [C]fly [Am]  away with [G]you.
