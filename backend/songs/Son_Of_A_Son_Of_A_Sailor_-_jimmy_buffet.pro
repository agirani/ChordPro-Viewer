 [E] [D] [A] [E] [E] [D] [A] [E]

As the [E]son of a son of a sailor
I went [D]out on the [A]sea for ad[E]venture
Ex[A]panding the view of the [E]captain and crew
like a [B]man just released from in[E]denture
As a [E]dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have [D]chalked up [A]many a [E]mile.
Read [A]dozens of books about [E]heroes and crooks
and I [B]learned much from both of their st[E]yles.

[D]Son of a son, [A]Son of a son
Son of a son of a [E]sailor
[D]Son of a gun, [A]Load the last ton
One step ahead of the [E]jailor

Now [E]way in the near future,
[D]Southeast [A]of dis[E]order
You can [A]shake the hand of the man[E]go man
As he [B]greets you at the [E]border
And the [E]lady she hails from trinidad,
[D]Island [A]of the [E]spices
[A]Salt for your meat, and [E]cinnamon sweet
And the [B]rum is for all your good [E]vices.

[D]Haul the sheet in as we [A]ride on the wind
That our fore-fathers harnessed be[E]fore us
[D]Hear the bells ring as the [A]tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a [E]chorus

{c:Solo}
 [D] [A] [E]
 [D] [A] [E]

Now [E]where it all ends, I can't fathom my friends
If I [D]knew I might [A]toss out my [E]anchor
[A]So I'll cruise along always [E]searching for songs
Not a [B]lawyer, a thief or a [E]banker

[D]But a son of a son, [A]son of a son
Son of a son of a [E]sailor
[D]Son of a gun, [A]load the last ton
One step ahead of the [E]jailor

[D]I'm just a son of a son, [A]son of a son
Son of a son of a [E]sailor
The [D]sea's in my veins, my tra[A]dition remains
I'm just glad I don't live in a [E]trailer
