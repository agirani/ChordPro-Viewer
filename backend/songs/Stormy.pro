[Verse 1]

        (top notes of Am9 (B) and Gmaj9 (A) implied by vibes)

        Am9              Gmaj7
            You were the sunshine, baby
        Am9              Gmaj7
            Whenever you smiled
           Am9         Gmaj7   Cmaj7
        But I call you Stormy today

        Am9      Gmaj7            Am9           Gmaj7
        All of a sudden that ol' rain's fallin' down
           Am9          Gmaj7     Cmaj7
        And my world is cloudy and gray
                     Bm7   B7
        You've gone away

[Chorus]

            Em9    A13
        Oh, Stor...my
            Em9    A13
        Oh, Stor...my
          Cmaj7         Bm7       Em9  A13
        Bring back that sunny day

[Verse 2]

        Am9         Gmaj7           Am9         Gmaj7
        Yesterday's love was like a warm summer breeze
        Am9          Gmaj7       Cmaj7
        But like the weather you change

        Am9            Gmaj7                  Am9       Gmaj7
        Now things are dreary, baby, and it's windy and cold
        Am9         Gmaj7        Cmaj7
        And I stand alone in the rain
                     Bm7   B7
        Calling your name

[Chorus]

            Em9    A13
        Oh, Stor...my
            Em9    A13
        Oh, Stor...my
          Cmaj7         Bm7       Em9  A13
        Bring back that sunny day

[Sax solo over chords to second half of verse]

[Coda]

          C6            Bm7   Em9  A13
        Bring back that sunny day
            Em9    A13
        Oh, Stor...my   (repeat to fade)
