[Am]  Hot town, [Am/G]summer in the city; [D/F#]back of my neck getting [F]dirty and [E]gritty
[Am]  Been down, [Am/G]isn't it a pity; [D/F#]doesn't seem to be a [F]shadow in the [E]city
[E]  All around, p[E7]eople looking half dead
[Am]Walking on the sidewalk, [A7]hotter than a match head

[D]  But at night it's a [G]different world
[D]  Go out and [G]find a girl
[D]  Come-on come-on and d[G]ance all night
[D]  Despite the heat it'll [G]be alright
And [Bm]babe, don't you [E]know it's a pity
That the [Bm]days can't [E]be like the nights
In the [Bm]summer, in the [E]city
In the [Bm]summer, in the [E]city

[Am]  Cool town, [Am/G]evenin' in the city; [D/F#]dressed so fine and [F]lookin' so [E]pretty
[Am]  Cool cat, [Am/G]lookin' for a kitty; [D/F#]gonna look in every [F]corner of the [E]city
[E]  Till I'm [E7]wheezin' like a bus stop
[Am]Runnin' up the stairs, gonna [A]meet you on the rooftop

[D]  But at night it's a [G]different world
[D]  Go out and [G]find a girl
[D]Come-on come-on and [G]dance all night
[D]Despite the heat it'll [G]be alright
And [Bm]babe, don't you [E]know it's a pity
The [Bm]days can't [E]be like the nights
In the [Bm]summer, in the [E]city
In the [Bm]summer, in the [E]city
