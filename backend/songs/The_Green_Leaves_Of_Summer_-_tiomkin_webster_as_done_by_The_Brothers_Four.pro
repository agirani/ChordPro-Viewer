[Dm]Ooooh [D]oooh [Dm]ooooh [D]oooh

A [Dm]time to be [A]reaping, a [Dm]time to be [C]sowing
The [F]green leaves of [Gm]summer are [E]calling me [A]home
T'was [D]so good to be [Gm]young then in the [C]season of [F]plenty
When the [Dm]catfish were [E]jumping as [Dm]high as the [A]sky [Dm]

A time to be [A]plowing[Dm], a time to be [C]planting [F]
A time to be [Gm]courting a [E]girl of your [A]own
T'was [D]so good to be [Gm]young then, to be [C]close to the [F]earth
And to [Dm]stand by your [E]wife, at the [Dm]mome[A]nt of [Dm]birth [D]
[Dm]oooh [D]oooh
