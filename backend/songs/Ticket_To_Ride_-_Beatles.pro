I [A]think I'm [Asus4]gonna be [A]sad, I [Asus4]think it's to[A]day, yeah
The girl that's [Asus4]driving me [A]mad is [Asus4]going a[Bm]way [E]

[F#m]She's got a ticket to [D]ride, [F#m]she's got a ticket to [G]ride
[F#m]She's got a ticket to [E]ride, and she don't [A]care.

She [A]said that [Asus4]living with [A]me is [Asus4]bringing her [A]down, yeah 
For she would [Asus4]never be [A]free when [Asus4]I was a[Bm]round[E] 

[F#m]She's got a ticket to [D]ride, [F#m]she's got a ticket to [G]ride
[F#m]She's got a ticket to [E]ride, and she don't [A]care.

I [D7]don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice she ought to do right by [E]me
Be[D7]fore she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice she ought to do right by [E]me
