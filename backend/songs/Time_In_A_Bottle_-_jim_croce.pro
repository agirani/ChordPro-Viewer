 [Dm] [Dm(maj7)] [Dm7] [Dm6] [Gm6] [A7]

If [Dm]I could save [Dm(maj7)]time in a bo[Dm7]ttle [Dm6]
The [Gm6]first thing that I'd like to [A7]do   {c: play riff in reg time}
Is to [Dm]save every [Dm7]day till [Bb]eternity [Gm7]passes [Dm]away
Just to [Gm]spend them with [A7]you.

If [Dm]I could make [Dm(maj7)]days last fo[Dm7]rever [Dm6]
If w[Gm6]ords could make wishes come t[A7]rue
I'd sa[Dm]ve every da[Dm7]y like a [Bb]treasure [Gm7]and the[Dm]n
Again, I[Gm] would spend the[A7]m with you.

But there [D]never seems to [Dmaj7]be enough time
To [D6]do the things you [D]want to do Once you [G]find the[Gmaj7]m
[Em7]I've [A7][D]looked around [Dmaj7]enough to know
That [D6]you're the one I [D]want to go through [G]time with. [Gmaj7] [Em7] [A7]

 [Dm] [Dm(maj7)] [Dm7] [Dm6] [Gm6] [A7]

If [Dm]I had a box [Dm(maj7)]just for wi[Dm7]shes [Dm6]
And [Gm6]dreams that had never come [A7]true
The [Dm]box would be [Dm7]empty [Bb]except for the [Gm7]memory [Dm]
Of how t[Gm]hey were answer[A7]ed by you

But there [D]never seems to [Dmaj7]be enough time
To [D6]do the things you [D]want to do Once you [G]find the[Gmaj7]m
[Em7]I've [A7][D]looked around [Dmaj7]enough to know
That [D6]you're the one I [D]want to go through [G]time with. [Gmaj7]
 [Em7] [A7]

If [Dm]I could save [Dm(maj7)]time in a bo[Dm7]ttle [Dm6]
The [Gm6]first thing that I'd like to [A7]do   {c:- play riff in reg time}
Is to [Dm]save every [Dm7]day till [Bb]eternity [Gm7]passes [Dm]away
Just to [Gm]spend them with [A7]you
But there ne[D]ver seems to[Dmaj7] be enough time
To [D6]do the things you [D]want to do once you [G]find the[Gmaj7]m
[1 [Em7]bar]   [3/[A7]4 bar] I've loo[D]ked around en[Dmaj7]ough to know
That y[D6]ou're the one I w[D]ant to go through t[G]ime with.
   [Gmaj7]{c:1 bar}      [Em7]{c:1 bar}   [A7]{c:1 bar}
