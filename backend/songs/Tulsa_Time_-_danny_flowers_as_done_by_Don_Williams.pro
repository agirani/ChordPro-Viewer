[G]I left Oklahoma drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my [D]mind

I was goin' to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where the people all live so [G]fine

My baby said I's crazy, my momma called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this [D]time

'Cause you know I ain't no fool an' I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the [G]line

[G]Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa [D]time

Well you know I've been through it

When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa [G]time

[G]Well there I was in Hollywood, wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone [D]line

But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just wastin' [G]time

Well then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this [D]time

I had no business leavin' and nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa [G]time

[G]Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa [D]time

Gonna set my watch back to it

'Cuz you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa [G]time

[G]Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa [D]time

Gonna set my watch back to it

'Cuz you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa [G]time
