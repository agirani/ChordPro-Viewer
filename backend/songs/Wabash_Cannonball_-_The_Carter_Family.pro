{title: Wabash Cannonball}
{subtitle: The Carter Family }

O[G]ut from the wide Pacific to the [C]broad Atlantic shore,
she climb[D]s flowery mountains over [D7]hills and by the shor[G]e
Alt[C]hough she's tall and handsome and she's known quite well by all,
she's a regul[D]ar combination of the [D7]Wabash Cannonba[G]ll.

Oh, the easter[G]n states are dandy, so the we[C]stern people say,
Chicago[D], Rock Island, [D7]St. Louis by the w[G]ay.

To [C]the lakes of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall,
no change[D]s to be taken on the[D7] Wabash Cannonb[G]all.

Oh, lis[G]ten to the jingle, the rumor and th[C]e roar,
as she glides [D]along the woodlands over h[D7]ills and by the s[G]hore
She cl[C]imbs the flowery mountains, hear the merry hobos squall,
she glide[D]s along the woodlands, the Wa[D7]bash Can[G]nonball.

Oh, here[G]'s Old Daddy Cleton, let his name forever [C]stand,
and long[D] be remembered 'bo's [D7]throughout the la[G]nd
For he is a good old rounder, till the cu[C]rtain round him fall,
he'll be carri[D]ed back to victory on the W[D7]abash Cannonb[G]all.

I have rode [G]the I.C. Limited, also the Royal Bl[C]ue
acros[D]s the eastern countries on [D7]mail car number [G]two.
I have rode [G]those highball trains from c[C]oast to coast that's all,
but I[D] have found no equal to the [D7]Wabash Cann[G]onball.


Oh, lis[G]ten to the jingle, the rumble and t[C]he roar,
as she gl[D]ides along the w[D7]oodlands over hills and b[G]y the shore                        
She climbs the flowery mountains, h[C]ear the merry hobos squall,
she glide[D]s along the woodlands, the W[D7]abash Cann[G]onball
