I've paid my [Cm]dues [Gm7/C]
Time after [Cm]time [Gm7/C]
I've done my [Cm]sentenc[Gm7/C]e
But committed no [Cm]crim[Gm7/C]e

And bad mis[Eb]takes [Ab/Eb]
I've made a [Eb]few [Ab/Eb]
I've had my [Eb]share of sand [Bb/D]kicked in my [Cm]face
But [F7]I've come [Bb]through

And I mean to go [Ab/Bb]on, and [Bbm7(b5)]on, and on[Bb7], and on [C7]

[F]We are the [Am]champions, my [Dm]friends [Bb] [C7]
And [F]we'll keep on [Am]fighting till the [Bb]end [F#dim7]
[Gm7]We are the [C7/G]champions, [Bbm6]we are [Bbm6/Db]the [Edim7]cham - [Gdim7]pions
[F]No time for [Ebadd9/G]losers 'cause [Ab6]we are the [Bb]champions [Cm7add4]
Of the [Fm]world [Gm7] [Fm] [Gm7/F] [Fm] [Gm7/C]


I've taken my bo[Cm]ws [Gm7/C]
And my curtain [Cm]call[Gm7/C]s
You brought me [Cm]fame and fortune
And everything that [Gm7/C]goes with it
I thank you [Cm]all [Gm7/C]

But it s been no bed of [Eb]rose[Ab/Eb]s
No pleasure [Eb]crui[Ab/Eb]se
I consider it a [Eb]challenge
Before the [Bb/D]whole human [Cm]race
And [F7]I ain't gonna [Bb]lose

And I mean to go [Ab/Bb]on, and [Bbm7(b5)]on, and on[Bb7], and on [C7]


[F]We are the [Am]champions, my [Dm]friends [Bb] [C7]
And [F]we'll keep on [Am]fighting till the [Bb]end [F#dim7]
[Gm7]We are the [C7/G]champions, [Bbm6]we are [Bbm6/Db]the       [Edim7]cham - [Gdim7]pions
[F]No time for [Ebadd9/G]losers 'cause [Ab6]we are the [Bb]champions [Cm7add4]
Of the [F]world


W[Am]e are the cham[Dm]pions, [Bb]my [C7]friends
And [F]we'll keep on [Am]fighting till the [Bb]end [F#dim7]
[Gm7]We are the [C7/G]champions, [Bbm6]we are [Bbm6/Db]the       [Edim7]cham - [Gdim7]pions
[F]No time for [Ebadd9/G]losers 'cause [Ab6]we are the [Bb]champions [Cm7add4]
