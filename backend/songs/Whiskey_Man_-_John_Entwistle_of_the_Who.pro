{title: Whiskey Man}
{subtitle: John Entwistle of the Who}

Wh[G]iskey Man's my [F]friend he's with me [Eb]nearly [F]all the [G]time.
He[G] always joins me [F]when I drink and [Eb]we get [F]on just [G]fine.
N[D]obody has [Am7]ever seen him [G]I'm the [C]only [G]one.
S[D]eemingly I [Am7]must be mad, ins[G]ani[C]ty is [G]fun.
If [G]that's the [C]way it's [G]done.

D[G]octor's [F]say he's [G]just a [F]figment [G]of my [F]twisted [Eb]mind.
If [G]they can't [F]see my [G]Whiskey [F]Man they [G]must be [F]going [Eb]blind.

{c:(repeat for horn solo)}

[G]Two men dressed in [F]white collected [Eb]me two [F]days [G]ago.
They [G]said there's only [F]room for one and [Eb]Whiskey [F]Man can't [G]go.
W[D]hiskey Man will [Am7]waste away if [G]he's left [C]on his [G]own.
I[D] can't even [Am7]ring him cause he [G]isn't [C]on the [G]phone.
[G]Hasn't [C]got a [G]home.

[G]Life is [F]very [G]gloomy [F]in this [G]little [F]padded [Eb]cell.
[G]It's a [F]shame there [G]wasn't [F]room for [G]Whiskey [F]Man as [Eb]well.

[G]Whiskey Man's my [F]friend he's with me [Eb]nearly [F]all the [G]time.
He [G]always joins me [F]when I drink and [Eb]we get [F]on just [G]fine.
[Eb]we get [F]on just [G]fine
[F]just        [D]fine
