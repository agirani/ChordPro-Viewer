 [Em] [F#7] [Bm]

[Em]It seems the love I've known [A7]
Has always been [D]the most destructive ki[G]nd
[Em]I guess that's why now
[F#7]I feel so old
[Bm]Before my time

Yeste[Em]rday when I was [A7]young
the taste of life was [D]sweet as rain upon my [G]tongue
I teased at life as [Em]if it were a foolish g[F#7]ame
the way the evening [Bm]breeze may tease a candle flame

The thousand dreams I [Em]dreamed, the splendid things I [A7]planned
I always built [D]to last on weak and shifting [G]sand
I lived by night and [Em]shunned the naked light of the[F#7] day
and only now I [Bm]see how the years ran away

Yeste[Em]rday when I was [A7]young
so many happy [D]songs were waiting to be s[G]ung,
so many wild ple[Em]asures lay in store for [F#7]me
and so much pain [Bm]my dazzled eyes refused to see

I ran so fast that [Em]time and youth at last ran [A7]out
I never stopped to [D]think what life was all [G]about
and every conver[Em]sation I can now [F#7]recall
concerned itself with [Bm]me and nothing else at all

 [Em] [A7] [D] [G] [Em] [F#7] [Bm]


Yeste[Em]rday the moon was [A7]blue
and every crazy [D]day brought something new to [G]do
I used my magic[Em] age as if it were a [F#7]wand
and never saw the w[Bm]aste and emptiness beyond

The game of love I [Em]played with arrogance and [A7]pride
and every flame I [D]lit too quickly quickly [G]died
The friends I made all [Em]seemed somehow to drift [F#7]away
and only I am left [Bm]on stage to end the play

There are so many[Em] songs in me that won't be [A7]sung
I feel the bitter [D]taste of tears upon my [G]tongue
The time has come for[Em] me to pay for yest[F#7]erday 
when I was yo[Bm]ung
