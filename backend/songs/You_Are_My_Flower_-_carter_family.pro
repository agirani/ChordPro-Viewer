{title: You Are My Flower}
{subtitle: carter family}

[C]When summertime is gone
And snow begins to [G7]fall

You can sing this song 
And say to one and [C]all

You are my flower
That's blooming in the mountain so [G7]high

You are my flower
That's blooming there for [C]me

So wear a happy smile 
And life will be worth[G7]while

Forget the tears 
But don't forget to [C]smile
