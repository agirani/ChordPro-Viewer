{subtitle: John Prine}

While di[G]gesting Readers Digest in the [C]back of a dirty book store
A [D]plastic flag with gum on the back Fell out on the [G]floor.
Well I [G]picked it up and ran outside And slapped it on my window[C]shield.
And If [D]I could see old Betsy Ross Id tell her how good I [G]feel.

But, your [C]flag decal won’t get you into [G]Heaven anymore.
They’re al[D]ready overcrowded From your [G]dirty little war
Now [C]Jesus don’t like Killin’ No matter [G]what the reasons for.
And your [D]flag decal won’t get you into Heaven any[G]more. [Bb] [C] [D]

Well I [G]went to the Bank this morning And the [C]cashier said to me
[D]If you join the Christmas Club We'll give you ten of them flags for [G]free.
[G]I didn’t mess a round a bit I took him up on what he [C]said
And [D]stuck them stickers all over my car And one on my wifes fore[G]head.

But, your [C]flag decal won’t get you into [G]Heaven anymore.
They’re al[D]ready overcrowded From your [G]dirty little war
Now [C]Jesus don’t like Killin’ No matter [G]what the reasons for.
And your [D]flag decal won’t get you into Heaven any[G]more. [Bb] [C] [D]

Well I [G]got my windshield so filled with flags I couldn’t [C]see
So I [D]ran my car upside a curb and right into a [G]tree
By the [G]time they got a doctor down I was already [C]dead,
And I’ll [D]never understand Why the man,
Standing in the Pearly Gates [G]said…

But, your [C]flag decal won’t get you into [G]Heaven anymore.
We’re al[D]ready overcrowded From your [G]dirty little war
Now [C]Jesus don’t like Killin’ No matter [G]what the reasons for.
And your [D]flag decal won’t get you into Heaven any[G]more. [Bb] [C] [D]
