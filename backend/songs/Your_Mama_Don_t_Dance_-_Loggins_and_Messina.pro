Your [A]mama don't dance and your [D]daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
Your [D]mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
When [E]evenin' rolls around and it's [D]time to go to town,
where do you [A]go to rock and roll?


The [A]old folks say that you [D]gotta end your day by t[A]en.
        ( play intro )
If you're [D]out on a date and you bring it home late, it's a s[A]in.
       ( play intro )
There [E]just ain't no excusin', you [D]know you're gonna lose
and never [A]win. I'll say it again. And it's all because ...


Your [A]mama don't dance and your [D]daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
Your [D]mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
When [E]evenin' rolls around and it's [D]time to go to town,
where do you [A]go to rock and roll?

You [D]pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park.
You [D]hop into the back seat where you know it's nice and dark.
You're [D]just about to move in, you're thinkin' it's a breeze.
There's a [D]light in your eye and then a guy says:

"Outta the car, longhair!"
"Ooh-[E]wee! You're comin' with [D]me, the local po[A]lice!"


And it's all because ...
Your [A]mama don't dance and your [D]daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
Your [D]mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and r[A]oll.
        ( play intro )
When [E]evenin' rolls around and it's [D]time to go to town,
where do you [A]go to rock and roll?
Where do you [A]go to rock and roll?
Where do you [A]go to rock and roll?
